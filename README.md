Straz Miejska Simulator (Muncipal Police Simulator) is an assignment I made for college.
It is a Console Application written in C#. Build can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=13zx_fyQFRLom22jd6StePKtySJAH3nw1

The topic for this assignment was "Organization Simulator: Muncipal Police" with the following features required:
1. User is able to manage the officers
2. User has a budget
3. User can see the current day
4. User is able to send officers on a patrol
5. User can equip officers with items
6. User is able to hire new officers
7. There are transport means; user is able to upgrade transport means
8. There is a fight system
9. There is a "map" of the city

I implemented those features as a game-like way. You can hire officers and send them on a patrol to various locations - Marketplace, Parking Lot, Green Square or Church. In each of this locations different Incindents may occur - you can find new items, gain or lose your money or even get into a Pokemon-style fight. Since it was a college assignment, the whole "game" is written in a humoristic way - it is not a professional project. All texts faced by the user are in Polish, but the code under the hood is in English.
